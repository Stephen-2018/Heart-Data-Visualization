# Heart-Data-Visualization
**Objective:** The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize heart disease data to gain insights into patterns and risk factors associated with heart conditions. The project leverages Python's data analysis and visualization libraries to provide graphical representations of various metrics, enabling better understanding and interpretation of heart-related health data.

**Project Overview:** The project focuses on using a dataset that includes various attributes related to patients' heart health, such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other vital statistics. The visualization will help identify trends, correlations, and potential outliers within the dataset. By leveraging tools such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, the project aims to highlight the factors contributing to heart disease and assist healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions.

**Key Features:**

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the heart disease dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing the data for accurate visualization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using descriptive statistics to explore relationships between attributes like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart disease.
2. Visualizations:
-Histograms to represent distributions of individual attributes (e.g., age, cholesterol).
-Scatter plots to show relationships between variables such as age vs. cholesterol.
-Correlation heatmaps to reveal how different factors are correlated with heart disease.
-Box plots to visualize distributions and identify outliers in blood pressure and cholesterol data.
-Pie charts to show the distribution of heart disease occurrences across different age groups or genders.
3. Risk Factor Analysis: Visualizing the influence of key risk factors such as age, cholesterol levels, and smoking habits on the likelihood of heart disease.
4. Conclusion: Summary of insights derived from the visualizations and recommendations for further analysis or interventions.
